# hello_world
My first repository!

This is my first time ever using this software before and I am not going to lie, I have no idea what I am doing. I hope that by the end of this tutorial I won't be as lost. But hey, who knows. I get lost pretty easily all the time, but that's just because I get so distracted by literally everything around me. I think this enough to say about myself for this tutorial.
